# Progressive Web App Text Editor

## Project Description
------

In this project I built a text editor that runs in the browser. This app is a single-page progressive web application. Additionally, it has a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. This application also functions offline.

It utilizes a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data.
